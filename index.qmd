We are band of data detectives with diverse superpowers in neuroscience, genetics, bioinformatics, and a flair for caffeine alchemy. We operate at the intersection of big data, genomics, and neurodegenerative enigmas, wielding cutting-edge algorithms and a pinch of statistical wizardry. From decoding the mysteries of MS progression to untangling the quirks of sleep analysis, our research illuminates the brain's secrets while testing the limits of both science and our HPC's patience. Fueled by experiments (and generous coffee breaks), we aim to show that science is not just groundbreakingâ€”it can be a lot of fun, too!
